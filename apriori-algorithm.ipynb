It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database.**\n\n**Why Apriori**\n\nApriori helps us understand the buying patterns of customers, \nExample - Customers buying a lot of goods from a grocery store, by applying this method of the algorithm the grocery stores can enhance their sales performance and could work effectively.\n\n**Antecedent and Consequent**\n\nThe IF component of an association rule is known as the antecedent. The THEN component is known as the consequent.\n\nE.g., IF milk THEN bread, milk -> bread\n\n**Support, Lift, Confidence, Antecendent and Consequent**\n\n**support = occurance of item / total no of transaction.**\n\n**confidance = support ( X Union Y) / support(X).**\n\n**lift = support (X Union Y)/ support(X) * support(Y) .**\n\nThe LHS is the Antecedent. The RHS is the Consequent. Note: Based on the data, the rules are created. For rule 1:\n\nFor example if,\n\nSupport says that 67% of customers purchased milk and cheese. Confidence is that 100% of the customers that bought milk also bought cheese. Lift represents the 28% increase in expectation that someone will buy cheese, when we know that they bought milk. This is the conditional probability.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#pip install
